# Imthatcreativewithnames.theme.css
[WIP] Discord theme which (attempts) to make it look like IRC. USE WITH DARK THEME AND COMPACT MODE ONLY
Also I use it with 75% zoom, so if something is broken or doesn't look right that might be why but it shouldn't be an issue.

There are no plans atm to make it work with white theme, or make it easily to customize but it's not really that hard.
